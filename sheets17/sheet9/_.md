## 1. Write a program to implement selection sorting algorithm of an array of characters as a class. Then in the main function create an object from the class and sort array of characters input from the user

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Sort{
public:
    void SelectionSort(char array[],int n){
        int smallest;
        char temp;
        if (n < 2) return; // nothing to sort!!
        for (int i = 0; i < n-1 ; i++)
        {
            // find smallest in unsorted part of array
            smallest = i;
            for(int j = i+1; j < n; j++)
                if(array[j] < array[smallest])
                    smallest = j;
            // put it at front of unsorted part of array (swap)
            temp = array[i];
            array[i] = array[smallest];
            array[smallest] = temp;
        }
    }
};


int main(){
    Sort sort;
    char a[] = "zxcvbnmsdfh";
    sort.SelectionSort(a, 11);
    
    cout << a << endl;
}
```

## 2. Write the pseudocode of an algorithm that find the duplicate number in an array of integers

```sdo
Find Duplicate Number in an array
Input: A[],n
Output: d

    for i <- 0 to n-1
    do
        for j <- 0 to n-1
        do
            if A[i] = A[j]
                return <- A[i]
            Endif
        Endfor
    Endfor
```

## 3. Given two sets of numbers, write the pseudocode of an algorithm that find the intersection of the two sets. Then, implement your algorithms as a class storing the number sets in arrays

```cpp
//TODO Solve this
```

## 4. Write the pseudocode of an algorithm that implement the queue using two stacks and implement your algorithm as a class. Then in the main function create an object from the class and enqueue, dequeue and display data from the queue

```cpp
//TODO Solve this
```
